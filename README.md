# data-science-imputations
Decription:
The purpose of this project is to import any given data set and impute the missing or null values using mean and mean-condition imputations. 
This can be useful in analyzing massive data sets with a large number of missing values. The program will parse the data set and calculate
a value based on the average of the column the missing value belongs to. 

Getting Started:
In order to get started, clone the repository to your desktop and change the filename to be imported in each method. The file being imported
must exist in the source code directory and be in csv file format.
